# Data

## UCLA Energy ATLAS - 2016
 
Energy consumption per kWh in Los Angeles County. This data could be used in the project to determine what types of neighborhoods are consuming high or low volumes of energy. An additional data set on income would also provide a better picture on who gets to use more energy, especially on extreme heat days.

## Climate at a Glance: City Time Series - Los Angeles, California Average Temperature
 
Average temperature recorded each month from 2000-2021. This data set will help visualize how temperatures have been increasing in Los Angeles. I am still looking for a data set on temperatures on a neighborhood level which would better reflect how different communities in LA are being impacted by extreme heat.
